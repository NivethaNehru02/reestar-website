 🌟 Welcome to the Reestar Restaurant Website! 

Hey there! I’m super excited to share this project with you all. This is the place where we’ll be building a stunning website for Reestar Restaurant

I’m just getting started on this journey, and Day 2 of development is already looking awesome! So, if you’re curious about what’s cooking (literally and figuratively!), here’s everything you need to know.

🚀 Features You’ll Love :

A Beautiful Menu: I’ve put together a gorgeous layout to showcase all the mouth-watering dishes. Because, let’s be honest, the food is the star of the show! 🍔🍕🍣
Smooth Hover Effects: I’ve added some cool hover effects to make navigation feel snappy and fun. You’ll love how interactive it is! 😎
Sleek, Modern Design: Minimal, elegant, and stylish. The kind of design that makes you say, “Wow, this restaurant is top-notch!” ✨
